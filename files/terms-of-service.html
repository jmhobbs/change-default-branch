            <p>This is here to protect the volunteers who create and operate this software. You should read it and agree before using the service.  The long and short is that we cannot guarantee the service is free from bugs, and there is an inherent risk when using a service like this.  If you are not comfortable with that, we encourage you to download your own copy, audit it and run it locally.</p>
            <p>That's what is so great about Open Source software.</p>
